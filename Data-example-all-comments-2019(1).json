Otherwise, how can those young Chinese children master it?\n\nI can share my experience as a person who has studied Chinese for 6 years:\n\n1. First of all, we should have a good attitude and not rush to success\n\n2. Learning Chinese spelling\n\n3. Learn to use Chinese dictionary as a tool to look up every Chinese character you don't know\n\n3. Find some basic Chinese learning materials and start reading and reciting. When I learn Chinese, I often buy some bilingual reading materials in both Chinese and English online, which are all e-books very cheap. Here is the link\nhttps://payhip.com/b/ykR2\n\n4. This method may seem simple, but it is really effective,\n\nBecause the brain's language expression is mostly unconscious. If you can't recite skillfully, you will be stuttered in the daily communication process, which is very embarrassing. But when you recite a large number of Chinese sentences (not necessarily fully understand the meaning) and then communicate with the Chinese people, some daily expressions will come out very easily. For example, I recited one at the beginning Some simple children's Chinese and English books (some classic fairy tales) have learned some simple Chinese expressions within three months. I have been able to express my meaning in simple Chinese. After one year's persistence, I have been able to communicate normally in Chinese in my work and daily life. I also know many Chinese friends, who are very enthusiastic. Of course, I am still learning Learn more complex expressions, such as idioms and some sentences that can't be translated in English. Learning a language can well experience the differences and fun between different cultures. When you can speak Chinese more and more skillfully, you will well understand their culture and philosophy, so recite a lot!",

            "I've been studying Chinese for 6 years now and I've noticed some pronunciation problems. When you were pronouncing \u627e the zh should be a bit sharper, something like the j sound in jam (I'm not English native so it's harder for me to find the right words) and the \u542c\u8d77\u6765... the t sound should also be a bit sharper, it sounded more like \"jing\" to me. I understood everything, but I just wanted to point this out. :) fighting :) i know Chinese is hard and I appreciate everyone who can learn it and speak. I hope my comment will be helpful. :)",
